How to Compile and Run

To use these programs, open your terminal in the **base directory**

1. Compilation<br>
To compile a specific exercise, run `make` followed by the **folder number**. The Makefile will automatically find the correct folder and source file.

(Examples)
Compile the program in folder Lab01_xxxxxx<br>
`make 1`<br>
Compile the program in folder Lab25_xxxxxx<br>
`make 25`<br>
This creates an executable named main in your current directory.<br>

2. Execution

Run the compiled program:

`./main`

3. Clean Up

To remove the main executable from the root directory (and any executables created inside subdirectories), run:

`make clean`
